  "text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come, a lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who know nothing. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come along, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double-click the VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You read the agreement quickly here. This license applies to... Damages. And after this, I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I am the fastest reader in the world. Next. It is important to check both icons here. It is very important to check both icons. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut on the desktop. Click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this, we will do the next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow, then there is no problem. It will be a little slow to install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally, you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner-friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please, you guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will be done in that too. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will be done in that too. Let's set it up here. And show what is there in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here, let's set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I have done all this. Next section. After this, next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again, here are some tips. I am telling you. That's it. Your VS Code is here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you. That you close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in Windows. So you can see here. That an option called Open with Code is coming. This option called Open with Code. Helps you open this particular folder in VS Code. You will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say, Yes, I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes, I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus here. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write it now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s. It will be saved. I will recommend you. Go to the file. Enable the auto save option here. So as you type. You will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want. Save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I want to do with you. Click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor. Mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? Just check this. And close it in settings. Now you don't have to be afraid. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is VS code? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes. But you don't have to see all this. Now you press ctrl. Simply like this. If you scroll. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. In the folder named. Sigma web development course. What happened? That this file was made. Index.html. Which is very easy. You can see. Which is very natural. Because. I have opened this folder in VS code. So because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file. With the name of this.txt. I will write this is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. You can see. So this folder. And the VS code. Both are running in sync. Okay. Now if I open this file from here. From notepad. And I show you. My file is opened in notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I won't use notepad. Because the VS code. I have to write. Because in VS code. There are some things. Which notepad doesn't give me. And I want. That I get those features. I don't want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS code. Which you don't get in notepad. If I write here. Suppose. HTML. If I hit enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template. Of HTML. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of HTML. It came here. We will discuss about it later. Now you guys. Absolutely. Don't worry. I will tell you. That is. I will tell you. That is. VS Code is very easy. You guys. Don't get overwhelmed by it. But I just want to tell you. That how this. How it benefits. VS Code. Why we didn't use notepad. Why VS Code. And this feel. It's such a good feeling. That developer feeling. The hacker feeling. That feeling is also important. That's why the confidence will come. To do coding. And for Mac and linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly. Similar things are going to be. For you guys. I am using windows. Because I have windows laptop. Not all three laptops. I can't use. But now mac and windows. Can't use all three together. But I want to say. You guys. you can't use it, so things will be exactly the same for you, in fact I should say things will be similar, not exactly the same, but very similar things, okay, so you will be able to follow along very easily, so don't take tension at all, I will tell you about some extensions in a while and you will enjoy using those extensions and you will also say that it is fun, what did you recommend, but I will tell you in a while, and this is criminally underrated, I am telling you that you will enjoy, before that I would like to tell you here if you right click and click on command palette, then here you will get a lot of options for VS Code, you don't need to know all these options, as we move forward in the course, whatever feature will be used, I will keep telling you in a while and you can use it, but now what I will do here, I will toggle a screen cast mode, you don't have to do this, but I will do it, so you will know what will happen, I clicked, so now see I will type anything, if I press caps lock, then caps lock will be clicked here, so you will know which button I pressed, now this is not relevant for you, but I just want to tell you that the screen cast mode, we can change the settings of the screen cast mode from here, now see here, the screen cast mode has a vertical offset, what does vertical offset mean, if I make vertical offset 0, then it comes up, if I make vertical offset 70, then it comes down, I will make it 60, if I make it 80, then it comes here, that is, from bottom, how much will it look up, so I made it 0, in fact, I made it 1, now I will type anything here, if I do this, it will show you at the bottom, which is ideal, so what I will do is close this file, close the settings tab, these are tabs, like chrome has tabs, these are exactly the same tabs, I hope you know what it is, you will forget what we have written about it, I will tell you step by step what exactly is it, you can also close the welcome page of VS Code, by any chance if you want to zoom in VS Code, which I will do because I am recording a video, now add control plus numpad plus, see below I have shown you that I am zooming in, I am zooming in because I am recording videos, so ideally I would like you to see the screen from close, but when I am doing my coding, I don't zoom in so much, so you have to keep this thing in mind, so these are related to VS Code, now I want to tell you how websites work, a website basically works through 3 types of people, imagine 3 people, one is client brother, one is server brother, who is client brother, second is server brother, third is browser brother, who is also called babu brother, browser brother, so browser brother, client brother, server brother, what is this client, what is this server, what is this browser, I am the client, you, all of us who use a browser, who is the browser, this is chrome, hello chrome, I am the client, I will say this to the client, when I write codewithharry.com, suppose I write codewithharry.com, so what I basically say, I say to this browser that please give me codewithharry.com website, or if I write youtube.com, I say give me youtube.com website, I say browser give me youtube.com, I want to watch youtube, what does the browser say, you want youtube, take this, so here I will enter youtube.com, so it brought youtube.com from the server, are you understanding, it brought youtube.com from the server, and showed me this screen, this work happened so fast, because my internet speed is very fast, it is so less nowadays, people's speed is also fast, but still, according to my locality, it is very fast, so with this fast internet speed, all these things are happening very fast, so the client sends a request to the server, through the browser, the browser is the client's, that is, my assistant, whatever I will say through the browser, it will help me to bring this web page from the server, who is managing the server, youtube is managing the server, youtube.com's server is being managed, and some code is written inside that server, which sends me this kind of code, that is, when I write youtube.com, this code came, now how to convert this code into this, this is the job of the browser, that is, how to show me, this is the job of the browser, so the client says something like this, hey, give me youtube.com, the browser says, do you want youtube.com, wait, I will ask for youtube.com from youtube.com, then the browser goes to the server, that is, it sends a request to the server, it says give me youtube.com from the server, the server will either give it to him, or it will say that it is not there, or it will say error, or it will say that the server has been errored, it has not been found, whatever the response will be, ideally it should be 200, there is a response code, 200, with that response, our browser comes back to the client and shows this kind of page, I hope this is clear to you, client, browser, server, okay, so the client is with the browser, the browser is with the server, back to the browser, so this is how this thing works, this thing is a little more important, let me tell you once again, when you write google.com, any website google.com, then the client says from the browser, bring me google.com, the browser says, hey gurudev, you want google.com, wait, I will also bring it from the server, so the browser goes to the server and brings google.com, and gives it to you, you get google.com, now along with google.com, the server sends all the images, all the videos, whatever things are there, it sends all these icons, the URL of these icons is also written in this code, and that too the job of the browser is to display it properly, so the server sends a whole bundle to the browser, sends a bundle like this, and passing this bundle and showing it like this, this is the job of the browser, now whoever interacts further, the user will send additional requests to the browser with this page, if I do it right and inspect, and then I go to the network, and I write here, let's say, Harry bhai, I wrote Harry bhai, so he sent so many requests for images, and many more requests, so as you interact, more requests will have to be sent additionally to the browser, so in total, you can consider it like a restaurant, you have ordered, that is, on the request page, as soon as you ordered, a waiter took your order, that waiter then went inside the kitchen, he sent your order to the kitchen, consider the kitchen as a server, and after that, finally, when the kitchen gave the order back, so what did this waiter do, which is the job of the browser, that waiter saw you again, the order, it is possible that the order cannot be made in the kitchen for any reason, it is very rare that you order something and you did not get it, but it happens sometimes, like here too, sometimes you get to see an error, 404 error, or 500 error, server is not working, such errors, so whenever you get to see such errors, then also you are told, but ideally, 200 means ok response comes, and you get such a webpage, so you can also consider it like a restaurant, so whenever you write google.com, so if google.com is available, then it will show you, and if you write codewithharry.com, so if codewithharry.com is available, then it will show you, if it is not available, then it will show you 404, or if there is 500 error, then it will show you a page with 500, whatever server will send, it will show you, so this cycle keeps on going, client sent the request, browser then sent the server, server then processed the request, after this, server sent the data back to the browser, and whatever data was sent, browser showed it to the client, then client did something, browser sent the same request to the server, then server sent something, whatever data the server sent, it came back to the client through the browser, and so on, so now you will say, all this is fine, but what is backend, what is the meaning of backend, backend is how the server is processing the request, now if you have a blog, blog has a lot of data, so what you will do, you will store every webpage of the blog separately, or you will generate that content dynamically, you will generate that content dynamically, I will take the example of google, if I search harry bhai, so you can see here that the header of google, these are the links, this format doesn't change at all, if I write here, let's say shubham, so as soon as I write shubham here, now see, when I wrote harry bhai, google is showing me a similar content, so what does google do, the backend of google's server, backend processes the data in such a way that it can send such HTML for the corresponding query, that is, when I write shubham, it sends this, when I write harry bhai, it sends this, so the process of generating this thing is happening through the system, that is the backend, now this backend can be jango, this backend can be flask, this backend can be nodejs, this backend can be php, this backend can be ruby on rails, and the database inside the backend is used, that is, the backend code is not visible to the client, this is the frontend code that the server sends, and how the server made this code, we don't know, because this code is running on the server, if you are getting confused, then don't get confused at all, you will understand all these things, we will see the backend later, now we understand how the frontend works, the frontend is primarily made up of 3 languages, html, css and javascript, these are the 3 languages that are needed if you are making a website, so every website needs html, css and javascript in most of the cases, if you only use html, then it becomes a very basic skeleton of the website, after that when you use css, you can style it, like the way this button looks, it is visible only because of css, along with that, this button is visible here, this button is visible here, it is visible in a curved way, this is all happening with the help of css, the edges that you see here, all this is happening with the help of css, so the work of css is to style a page, what will be the color of which button, what will happen by hovering, all these things are done through css, in a way, the beauty of css is the html page, html is the existence, the body of any page, something like this, this is a standard that has been agreed, if anyone makes a website, then it will be made on html, so that the browser makers can understand the work of the browser is to parse the html, and html is a skeleton, this is a standard, anyone who makes a website in this world, will make it in html, skeleton will use html, this is a standard, such a standard has been made so that everyone makes the same type of pages, and if anyone is making a browser, then the same language has to be parsed, if as a beginner you have learned 80% html, then you are good to go for web development, now some things happen directly from html, like if I write a very quick html code for you, then I am writing html code in this way, I have used the emmet abbreviation by hitting the exclamation mark, you do not worry at all how I wrote this code, I will write hey this is html, and I can open this html file directly in this way, and as soon as I open this html file directly, you see it will open in this way, I can open it directly by double clicking here, and it is open, now see hey this is html is written, but it is not styled at all, that is, this html file is very basic, now you can run videos directly from html, I have an html file which I show you, with which you can run videos, I do one thing that I show you by changing this html file, such that we can show videos in it, so html has a video tag, if you hit enter video, then whatever video you put in src will be played, like if I put video 1.mp4 here, you see vscode has automatically shown me video 1.mp4, this is the benefit of using vscode, so you see here that I will reload it, so here this video is automatically shown, I can play it, to play I will have to write controls here, and I will refresh it now, so I will get the controls to play, I can play, this ship has come, the man needs money, he wants 130 crores, now if I put video 2.mp4 here, I had put video 1 here, I have two more videos outside, I have some more videos here, if I put it here, and then I refer them, if I put video 2.mp4 instead of it, then video 2 will be seen, I will reload it and show you, this was the look alike of Ben Stokes, now if I put video 3 here, then my third video will play, so I will reload it, and you see I can play it, so our third video is played, I put video 3.mp4 here, so I will close it, and similarly we can play video 4, and video 4 is a DJ video, in which DJ is played, so you see, so you can make such things using only HTML, means you don't need to do anything else, you can play videos, images, all this can be done using HTML, now if you want to style it, like if I want a border on it, or a red color background, so for that I have to use CSS, CSS adds beauty to any website, then comes JavaScript, which adds interaction to a website, for example, what will happen when I click on search, what will happen when I write code with Harry, like code with HR, and here auto complete, why it came, because a request went to the server, and for this query, auto complete results came, so all these things are done with JavaScript, this is called client side scripting, means if we want to do scripting or coding in the client, only on the client side, then we can do it with the help of JavaScript, so this is brain, so our website is beauty with brain, I am talking about the website, beauty with brain, CSS adds beauty, and brain comes from JavaScript, now JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic easily, like if you want to change the content without loading the page, then all this work is done with JavaScript, here a lot of mosquitoes are coming, so let me kill them, oh, they are mosquitoes, nothing is happening to them, my racket is working, oh my god, like the video, because I eat the snacks of current for you, so when I was in college, someone told me that HTML, CSS, JavaScript, you have to learn one by one, first learn 100% HTML, then learn 100% CSS, till you learn all the properties, then learn JavaScript, but this assumption is wrong, why it is wrong, because HTML you only 80%, and CSS you only 40-60%, and JavaScript you only 50-70%, you can start web development, you can make projects, and while making, you can move ahead, in this course, I will tell you about the impact of chat GPT and web development, so we will talk about this also, you stay tuned, so never run after perfection, with HTML, with CSS, don't think that I will do HTML for one year, then CSS for next year, then JavaScript for third year, then I will make projects in fourth year, don't think like this, do HTML 80%, CSS 40-60%, and learn JavaScript 50-70%, so that you can make a very good website, and as you make website, your experience will teach you more HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and you will not even know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript, while you are making money, and working as a professional web developer, so you are earning along with learning, and with that you are also improving your skills, so never think that I will make a website only when I remember all the HTML tags, I will make a website only when I remember all the CSS properties, I will make a website only when I remember all the JavaScript, I will teach you only that much, only that much, that matters, we are going to learn what matters, and I don't want you to learn only for years, that's why I have designed this course in this way, so that you can learn only what matters, and you will learn the rest from practice, and I am going to make you do a lot of practice in this course, here to learn the Sigma web development course, 2-4 mosquitoes have also come, which is good, our audience is increasing, in this course, we will learn HTML first, then CSS, then JavaScript, and I will tell you such tricks in this course, which you must have not heard anywhere, and I have learned different points of my career, I will tell you in a course here only, I have learned some amazing tricks in my career, quite late, and I want you to learn all the tricks as soon as you start, now if you have any doubt in this course, in the coming videos, then you can use the hashtag doubt, you can use this hashtag and ask your doubt, I am going to try to answer all the doubts, I will try, I will try to solve your doubts, so if you have any question, then you can use the hashtag doubt, and please do not use the hashtag doubt, in the useless questions, or in the comments, you can write without the hashtag doubt, so that I can prioritize the reply of the hashtag doubt, I will try to answer all the doubts, as much as I can, and you will learn everything in this course, so like this course, if you have not done it yet, that will bring a smile on my face, now what is react, next.js, angular, so all these front end frameworks, help you to use javascript properly, so html, css, javascript, make the website, help to make this process fast, how? we will learn in this course, yes in this course, I told you that I will make this course for you, I will make you so different, that I will take you from zero to web development to hero, tie your seat belt, I have got the ticket of sigma web development express, I want to give you a very good analogy, html, css, to teach javascript, html is just like car skeleton, then I painted it, then css, and internal engine car, then that is javascript, as an example of a human, the skeleton is html, then skin, then css, and brain, that nervous system is javascript, now I will take you to Forbes.com, as soon as you go to Forbes, you will see a website, Forbes.com is a website, which uses html, css, and javascript, just like any other website, now if I click on right click, then see this inspect element is opened, now see here, they have used script in head, and to add css, they have used link, so what I will do here, I will remove their css, to remove css, I will simply clear their style tags, by using delete key, so as soon as I remove all these style tags, and all these link tags, so as soon as I delete all their style sheets, see what has happened to this page, this page is looking like this, it has only raw html, what should be the size of images, what kind of images should be there, they have forgotten all this, and only raw html is written here, which has not been styled at all, so this is the condition of this page, without css, it is showing only raw buttons, raw text, raw links, and similarly, I can see without javascript, how this page will look, now if I delete this page's html tag, like this, I have deleted head, so this is a blank page, so this is the role of html, css and javascript to make a web page, I want to tell you for your information, this course was initially made to be paid, but I changed my mood, and converted it into a free course, and I thought I will put it on youtube, so I want you all to be serious, many people have reached out to me, to launch this course as a paid course, but I felt that this course should be kept free, because when I was learning web development, I can understand, when you don't have a good course to learn, and you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course, so I can understand, so I thought of launching this course as a paid course, this course is free, but under this free course, you will earn crores of rupees, you will give me tea, coffee, parties and all the gifts, this is our agreement in this video, so when you start earning crores, then send me a green leaf, or maybe a red leaf, but you have to do this only when you start earning good, only after you start earning good, so keeping you aside, in the next video I will tell you, how to earn money after completing this course, I will put light on this, because this is also important, how to earn money, how I do freelancing, how clients come, I will tell you everything in this course, I want to tell you some action items, the first action item is, you have to access this course's playlist, I will give you the link in the description, everyone bookmark that playlist, press the star button here, and bookmark it, many of you said, the course is paid, thank you so much for all the support, and whatever you show me love, I get more courage, but this course is going to be free, now there should not be any technical issues, I am putting all these videos in 1080p resolution, so you should see it clearly, but many people say, that the video is in SD, you watch Bali ka Wadhu, you finish your mobile's internet, and you watch Bali ka Wadhu from morning to evening, and you say, call some municipality, so I hope you understood, what is request, what is response, how these websites work, we got a basic idea, how client-server interaction works, in the coming videos, we will see how the website is made, we are going to make our first website, so you should be very excited, because in the next video, we are going to make our first website, and it may be your first website, so access the playlist, thank you so much for watching this video, and I will see you next time. Thank you."
