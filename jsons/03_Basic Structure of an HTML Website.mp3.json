I'm really very happy that you guys have given so much love to this course. Like this course with high energy. Because for a Sigma free course, you need to like the Sigma chats. In today's video, I'll explain you the basic structure of a website. Along with that, I'll tell you a mobile trick which will help you guys know how to preview your websites on your phone. I have a request from you guys. You guys write in the comment section that do you know HTML or not. That will help me structure this course better. In this video, I'll tell you the impact of chat GPT. Because there are a lot of talks going on about chat GPT these days. In the coming videos, I'm going to give you guys quizzes. So understand this video very carefully and learn all the concepts. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And now we will talk about how to create a lay of a website based on opening text, closing text, and structure. So here I will make a folder named video3. New folder, video3. And in video3, I will open the code by right-clicking and selecting open with. And here you can see that my theme is blue. And a lot of people said that blue theme is not good. See, the theme is your own choice. If you want to change the color theme, then you can change your color theme. I want to use the dark one of GitHub, so I can use the dark one of GitHub. It's your choice. To make a new file, I will put index.html here. We had already talked about writing the title of the page here, and writing content here, and then using the link tag here, I can use Emmet to link style.css. I am doing it so fast because we have already talked about it in the last video. And if I write script.js here, and if I write, let's say, alert hello, then I will not tell you again and again that if I put a script tag here, just before the body, and then I put script colon src here and made it script.js, and then I clicked here and made it open with browser, then this hello will come, and if I make the body background red here, it will be red. I will not tell you all this, because I have already told you this. Now I will tell you what this structure means, why did I write it so big? A beginner has a doubt that we can't directly write this title and content, what is the need to write so much? So I will tell you what is the need to write so much. I will reload it. See, the content that we had here has come, and it has become red here. Now here you saw that I needed to reload the page, many of you must have asked why did I need to reload? When it already reloads live, so see I changed the CSS file, when I change the CSS file, at times we need to reload, if you are making changes in the HTML file, you will not need to reload the changes of the HTML file like this. Now here, what I will do, I will come back and explain to you, this is a basic structure of any HTML website, first of all we write doc type HTML, then we write HTML tag, now this is the opening of the HTML tag, this is the closing tag, this the opening gab of body here is the closing tag, this is the opening type of head and this is the closing tag, which means the masala inside it is the content of the head. The masala inside HTML is it's this. This is the content of HTML. Accordingly everything in the title, which is the content of title, and now if you ask about the content of Meta, so meta is a self-closing tag, There are two types of tags in HTML, one is self-closing tag, and one is pair tag, In pair tag, there is an opening tag and closing tag So this is the basic structure of HTML website Now here you can see that the background has turned red What is the reason for this? This is because of CSS If I remove CSS from here and tell CSS to move away from here What will I say to CSS? Move away from here quickly And as soon as I tell CSS to move away from here quickly It will have to move away from here I will reload the page So you can see that it has moved away Similarly, I can also say from JavaScript Move away from there quickly Now if I say from here, the alert will also stop So you see, if I reload now, the alert has also stopped So the CSS and JavaScript I added in this HTML content This is additionally CSS and JavaScript functionalities We used to link with this HTML page Now I have already told you about the title tag This page is used to set the title Now the only purpose of this is that you see the title above The search engines that are there, they also use it That is, the search engines are Google If you write here, code with Harry HTML So code with Harry's HTML introduction, HTML working I have put all these titles on the page You see here above, HTML introduction is the title of the page So these titles of the page are used by search engines And are parsed Now if I change the page here So here the HTML working title has been done Now I will change the page again You see here the HTML installation title has been done So the titles keep changing Along with that, as I keep changing it It will keep changing As you can see So the title of HTML pages does not mean only that You see this above This is also very useful in SEO And they tell what is the content inside the page So they describe the page content Like I am getting to know what is HTML execution here HTML execution means how HTML is being executed I am being told about this page So changing the title of the page is a very good SEO practice So we will make a website from any framework And we will keep changing the title of the page Now here is the head section The metadata of the page is inside the head section Like the title is done And which script do you want to link That is done Along with that, there are other meta tags About which I will tell you later Meta tags basically mean How is the HTML document It is told about it Keywords are put Description is put Meta description is a very important keyword for SEO That is, you can write about what this page is about If you go to my website Then you will get to see here In view page source That meta description tag is put This is compressed HTML So don't be confused by this But here you can see That meta description tag is put Which describes this page If we talk about Google Then meta description Google shows here Now I want to show you people That doc type, HTML What happens inside the head after this Key page meta tags Title tags, script tags There are also link tags So now the script tag You can put it just before the body And you can put it above And what is the difference in this We will talk about it in the course But here you can see I used the link Added CSS again Then after this, the body is the main content of the website Which you can see on this page On this page So what you
