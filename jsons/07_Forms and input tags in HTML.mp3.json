Using a form is a very important element of some websites because through the form, you submit data from client to server.

On flight or railway ticket, the date and time, where to go and all these details are also submitted through the HTML forms.

So let's go to the computer screen, we will see about the forms, we will see about the input tags and we will see some best practices. Let's roll the intro. So guys I have come to my computer screen and now see I am going to make a folder here which I am going to name video6 because this is the sixth video. I will click on shift right, I will open with code, I have already told you all this. And here I am going to make index.html and what I will do by putting an exclamation mark in it, I will wrap the view word, I will turn on the screen cast mode and you will see here I will write forms, let's learn it. So I have set the title of this forms page here and what happened by setting the title that the title will be visible on our page in actual. Here I want to tell you a very important setting, show preview, many of you have pointed out to me in the comment that you have to click so many times, can you do something? Yes you can, here you click on the gear, click on settings and after clicking on settings, what you do simply, write live preview here, and we can actually set it such that whenever we click, it will open on the external browser. So now I will close everything, as soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser and I come to my browser and the playlist of the Sigma web development course is accessing it by clicking on the star and here on the bookmark. But now I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, you see it opened, so if you want this, then do this, but sometimes what happens is that you want to prefer side by side view and when you want to do that, when you are actually working on a design by using HTML, CSS. So whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see live previews here, which is why this extension was made and it was made different from the live server so that you can see the preview on the side. Now what we will do here, we will know about the forms, what is the form, you know the name of the form, it means that it is a railway form, we fill it and it becomes our reservation, along with that we fill the form of IIT JEE, the form of NEET, the form of any exam, so that our data can reach those who want it, so this is the form, HTML form tag is now as soon as you write the form, you will hit enter, in this way the first question will ask you what is the action of your form, get or post, get request and post request, I tell you a very quick difference, that we will see this thing later when we will read the backend, get request is a very simple request and post request is when we send in most of the cases when we have to give a lot of data, like whenever our form will be posted, then in most of the cases we will use post request and get request is a very simple request that we just have to tell the server something and that's it or we have to hit the server with a request, that's it, but if you don't understand this thing now, that should be fine, there is no problem, because we are going to do this in detail later, so form action is equal to post, I have written here, now I can show some input tags in it, I will tell you what are input tags, that what elements will come in your form, like you can put a date, you can put in the form, you can tell the name, you can tell the phone number, you can say that what is your age, it can be just a number, you want to put such things in the form, so I want to tell you that you put input tag in the form and there is a label tag which is used to label that input, so what I will do here, you see the simplest input tag is type is equal to text, so I will put the input type is equal to text here, and you see here, if I zoom out and show you, so see input type is equal to text, name is equal to username, placeholder is enter your username, and it will look something like this, so you can say here enter your username, and the user in front of you will have to enter the username, I write an H1 here, and I write here, assume form to apply for TA, for sigma web dev TA, sigma web development course TA, assume we are hiring teaching assistants for sigma web development course, so we can write something like this here, by the way I have put the subtitles, if you have not accessed the playlist, then do access it, and with that I show you one more thing, so the subtitles are very funny, I show you, write sigma batch op and give your village land to me, means someone is watching English, or someone is watching who does not know Hindi at all, he will say that what happened till here, and give your village land to me, I like this a lot, anyway now you can see here that I have put the H1 here, which is our heading, this is our main heading, enter your username, this is our input tag, along with the input tag, we use the label tag, so I will write the ID of this, for example I will write its ID username, and what I will do in for is equal to, I will put its ID, now what is this ID, I will tell you later, for now you just understand that this is a unique identifier of an element, to identify this element uniquely, like your Aadhar number cannot be of anyone else, in the same way this ID username is given to it, now it cannot be given to anyone else, this is the ID, I will tell you more in detail later, but now understand this, so I wrote label for is equal to username, I wrote the input tag, and you can see here that the label will come, so I have not put anything in the label, so I will put enter your username, and you can see that as soon as I put this, you will get to see enter your username, after this you can enter your username, along with that you can put anything here, like I want to ask what is your gender, so I can do something like this, and you see enter your gender, and as soon as I did this, I can ask you from male or female, now what happens here, sometimes we wrap it in div, what is div, div is our block element, and what are inline and block elements, I have not told you in this course yet, but I will tell you in the coming videos, so for now you just understand that I am putting it in div to give a new space, so as soon as I put it in div, it will come in a new space, yes, there is also a br tag, so here I have put name is equal to gender, and name is equal to gender, and as soon as I wrote type is equal to radio, it means radio button, and if we have made the name same, then only one can be selected from these two, that is, if I select this, then only this will happen, if I select this, then only this will happen, now I will show you one thing, if I make a mistake in the ID of the label form, and here also in the form, I do not make

along with that we have an input tag which is type is equal to check box, now see here if I put the input of type is equal to check box, I will do this work by putting it in div, and as soon as I do the format document by right clicking, our document will be very good, that is, its formatting and indentation will be very good, now see here, here subscribe to newsletter, here I can check it, and the difference between radio button and check box is that you can check the check box, here if you want male or female or any of the options, you can select it like this, after this we have text area and select tag, and I will show you what it is, so text area and select tag works like this, as soon as you copy the text area, I will show you by putting it here, text area input type is equal to text, but it has rows and column attributes, which helps you to make its size small, now see here, I have given the placeholder inside it, enter your comment, ideally we will keep it empty, or we will not give a new line in it, so I will paste it here, enter your comment here, and now it will reach to the left side, I will show you, so it has reached to the left side, enter your comment here, and

because we will style it with CSS later, for now I will just put br tag, but I don't recommend br tag, I am telling you again, I do not recommend br tag at all, because br tag has problems, by the way

is not that you don't have to use it, but I don't recommend using it all the time, because people think that the easiest thing is to put br tag and add new spaces, I oppose this a lot, so I will copy this and show you select tag, and now see here, as soon as I put select tag here, I put it inside div, so in select you get some options, the syntax of select is like this, so you can use any of the three, now see here, any of the three can be used, and here I have done value is equal to apple, first I made select tag, then option value is equal to apple, option value is equal to banana, option value is equal to cherry, when we will parse this form data, then I will tell you in the javascript part, how to take this data and send it to the server, so there are a lot of things about the form that are remaining, I am going to tell you, so stay tuned for that, so I wanted to tell you about all the elements of the form in this video, and along with that I have told you about select tag and all these things, about the form, the rest of the attributes, like action, I told you, you can submit form on any page from action, and where will it handle the form, so you can give that data here, then there is a method, get request or post request, I will tell you the difference in these two in the coming videos, but I have told you in a very rough way, that get request is a very simple request, post request is used when you have to send big data to the server, so there is a limit of get request, in post request you can send a lot of data, in get request we don't even send passwords, we send it with the help of post request, now here I have told you the method, what happens in name, name is equal to username, means we mark it with name, so the server will know which key value is corresponding to this, so the key value that will go to the server will go according to the name, its name and value will go, so we will see this when we will do server side processing, what is the meaning of placeholder, placeholder means what will be written inside it, so here enter your username, placeholder is there, if I click on it, then it will say enter your username, it is not written inside it, I will write anything, see it came, but enter your username is telling me that I have to put username inside it, then what is the meaning of required, you have to require it, you have to put the value of it, otherwise your form will not be submitted, so we will use this a lot, then after this we get autofocus, what does autofocus do, autofocus automatically focuses the cursor, so I will show you the magic of autofocus, so if you have written autofocus in the input tag, so I have written autofocus in enter your username, now I will reload it, so if I type on it, then it will automatically focus on it, so autofocus happens when you type, it will be typed here only, I hope you are understanding these things, now validation attribute required, I have told you, you can give a pattern in which you can give regular expression pattern, so that people don't get confused, don't say what are you talking about, we don't know regular expression, so I am sitting here to teach you all these things, but you understand that we will accept only one particular pattern, if we have put pattern is equal to this, then you can't put anything other than this pattern, so you should know this thing here, so I hope you are enjoying this video, and with that, do write sigma batch op in the comment section, and go to the first video and please review this course, because still many people ask me that should I do this course or not, free course is not valued by people, they say that this course is free, so we should watch it or take a paid course, and I would like to give a note for those people who told me that we have taken a paid course, now what should we do, they should collect money or we should join sigma batch, you guys join sigma batch, cut your losses and join sigma batch, because see what is the quality of this course, I don't think you need to tell me, so you guys do this, you will get everything here, I am telling you, don't think that this is free, I was going to sell you this course for 10,000 rupees, yes that was the amount which we fixed, I was going to sell this course for 10,000 rupees, and I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course, if anyone is selling, there is nothing wrong in selling any course, but the thing is that if you guys have bought any other course, and you still feel that sigma is a very good course, which is there, then you should join, cut your losses and join, because once you make your career, then you will not need any of these things in the future, if you guys look back in the future, then you will also say that we took a paid course, then we took a free course, which we understood, and once you guys make a career, then all these things will not matter in the future, so do what is right for you, and you work while understanding your cycle, I hope you are understanding things, so like the video, access the playlist, subscribe to the channel, and in the comment section below, write sigma batch op and name your village and town, that's all for now in this video guys, thank you so much for watching this video, and I will see you next time."}
