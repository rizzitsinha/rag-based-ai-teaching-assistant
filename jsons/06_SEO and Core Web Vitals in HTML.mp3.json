Vitals and why they are important. Like this video and keep your energy high. The thing is that your website should run on all devices in iPad, iPhone, Android, Surface Pro 4. Because we have to give a good experience to all users through our website. In this video, we will also learn that there is a hidden tool in Chrome called Lighthouse. And how you can use it to enhance your website. So write in the comment section below, Sigma Batch OP. Let's go to the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to my computer screen. And now I will make a new folder named Video 6. Video 6. And here in Video 6, I will open VS Code as always. And the thing I am going to tell you today is very important from the aspect of SEO. First of all, I want to tell you what SEO is. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. If you see any website, it has SEO in it. Let's take the example of Amazon.in. I opened Amazon.in. So Amazon.in wants this website to be loaded as soon as possible. So that their products can come in search. Google is a search engine. Google's responsibility is to show the best pages to the users. So Google wants to show only those pages that are fast. They present the information very well. And along with that, there are some things in them that the user has a good experience. For example, let's say there are two pages. One page has told about dog food. The other page has also told exactly the same thing about dog food. But the page 2 of these two is loaded very fast. It loads well. So Google will give it more preference. Along with that, there are core web vitals. Which Google considers to rank two pages. First of all, it is content. Content is the most important. What do you have on one page? If your content is good, then maybe your website can rank without core web vitals. But if you are competing with a page that has presented almost similar quality content. Then your core web vitals will be seen. And if your core web vitals are good, then you will be given preference. So the first thing that comes in the core web vitals is your CLS. You see this video here. Which I have run from the web.dev website. You will see that someone comes to your website. And he is trying to cancel the order here. And by mistake, the time he canceled, this thing above became visible. And he shifted the layout. And the order is complete. But the user wanted the order to be incomplete. He wanted to click on no. In this case, the user experience is very bad. And as you saw in this video, it should not be like this. That's why our CLS should be as low as possible. Now what is the definition of CLS? Cumulative layout shift means. How much is shifting while the page is loading. Assume that you have loaded the page. And first of all, you get to see this. It was above first. And after that, when this keyterm part was loaded. So everything shifted down. Layout should not shift. If you put width and height in images. Then the layout will not shift. The next metric we are going to talk about is LCP. And LCP stands for Largest Contextual Paint. This means that if the user is viewing a page. Then the biggest element on it. For example, the biggest part in this is this image. How long is it loading? Means the whole page will be loaded. But the biggest looking element. Which is the most important. How long is it loading? Assume that web.dev and Google. A good LCP score should be 2.5 seconds. Means the biggest element should be loaded in 2.5 seconds. After this comes the third metric which is FID. Which stands for First Input Delay. First Input Delay means that. If any user has clicked on any input element. Like on a button or any type of input. On a page. So how long does that input process? For example, if you click on a button. So how long does that button click browser process? And if we assume Google and web.dev. So in less than 100 milliseconds. Your input should start processing. So these were the three core web vitals. Which are very important. For your information. These core web vitals are updated. But these three are very important. And you should know. Now I will show you. What is the lighthouse report? And why do they generate? And how will these three core web vitals get value from there? So I will tell you here. If you will inspect by right clicking. And you may be coming to the right side. So you can click here and bring it down. By clicking here. If you want, you can bring it here again. And by clicking here, you can bring it down. I prefer it down. Because I am used to seeing it down from the starting. Now you can see the option of lighthouse here. Lighthouse basically generates a report for you. And tells you. What can be improved in your HTML page? For example, if I want to see here on mobile. How mobile users see my website. So I will click on mobile. Or I will click on desktop. I will close this tab. I will click on mobile. And I will click on analyze page load. So this will generate a report. Lighthouse for me. You can see here. That a report has been generated. In this, performance, accessibility. Best practices, SE and PWA. All these things are being shown. Now here you can see. Some things are shown in red. That is, the scope of improvement is in the page. Now here you are telling. That size your images properly. Your website can be loaded 2.7 seconds fast. So all these suggestions. They are given to you. Through lighthouse. And if you incorporate these suggestions. Then your website will be loaded quite well. And will give a good experience to the user. Now you can see here. Image elements do not have explicit width and height. So you should give width and height. The image width and height attribute. Which we read in the last video. That should be used. So that your browser. Reserved space. When we set width and height in HTML. Then the space is reserved in the browser. Otherwise if we do not set height and width. Then what will happen. That our browser. It will not know how much space to reserve. And as long as the CSS will load. All the page will shift from bottom to top. So we don't want our page. Shift in loading time. If our page starts shifting. So if we are going to click here. So by mistake when it shifts. Then we can click here. Suppose an image was going to come here. I am going to click here. And as long as I clicked. During that time. This image was loaded. And all this content shifted down. And instead of clicking here by mistake. I will click on the image. This is called cumulative layout shift. So this kind of shift. Is not preferred at all. Google does not prefer at all. And this should be the least. You can see that the space is very less. Cumulative layout shift. So we have to keep the cumulative layout shift. So that our user. Can get a very good experience. So here are many more suggestions. And this is for our mobile. Now we can generate a desktop report. And the desktop report will be generated. So as you can see. That it has generated a report. 92 marks in performance. 100 out of 82 in accessibility. 75 in best practices. 75 in SEO. Now you see here. That the good things. That have been told here. And the scope of improvement. That Lighthouse tells you. So this is a hidden tool. Which we should all use. Now I want to tell you. About meta tags and meta description. So what I will do here. That I will make a new file. I will name it index.html. And after making one html file. The first SEO element. I want to tell you. That is title. If your title is reflecting. The content of your page. Then this is a very good SEO practice. Whenever your page is changing. You make the title in such a way. That it reflects the content of your page. Because if you want your website on Google. Then it will come according to the title. The index of Google. Like you guys write here. Code with Harry. Okay. And you write like this. So this thing is the title of the page. And this is the title of the page. Which is put by the YouTube people. This is the title of the page. Which is put by the Instagram people. This is the title of the page. Which is put by the GitHub people. So if the title is put on the page. And the title actually. Which reflects the content of your page. Truly. Then your website will rank very well. Now let's say I put content here. And I put an h1. And I write here Harry. And after that let's say. I write a paragraph here. And I write here lorem 45. Now why did I write lorem 45? I will do view word wrap. Why did I write 45? This is a very good question. I wrote 45 because. Because I am lazy and 4 and 5 are around. So I wrote 4 and 5. I also write 23. Because they are also around. Okay, so there is no other reason. Now I will quickly preview it here. I will open in browser here. So see it looks like this. Now this document is written. If I leave it like this. Then this will not be a good SEO practice. I will write here about Harry. And I will write here code with Harry. Which is my website. Okay. And what will happen by doing this? That my title will reflect here. As you can see. So what will happen by doing this kind of work? That my website will have more chances to be seen in Google. By inspecting I will also take out its light house report. And I will see what are the scope of improvements. Now its light house report will be very good. Because there is nothing in it. Which I should improve. But when I will put images etc. Then I will get suggestions. Like put width. Put height. Along with that I will tell you one more trick. So that you can see your website in any mobile. You will find out. So you guys click here. Can you see the computer here? Click on it. And after that if you choose responsive in it. So you can see that. How your website will be seen in any kind of device. So you can see here if your website is responsive or not. By doing this. If you want to see in a specific device. Like in iPhone 12 Pro. Your website will look like this in iPhone 12 Pro's resolution. Now don't say why it doesn't have 15 or 16. 12 Pro means a big iPhone device. Understand okay. In such a big device. In such a big device. How your website will look. This is just being told to you guys. Okay. So now you guys can see here. How it will look in Surface Pro 7. By clicking here. How it will look in Google's phone. You can also find out this. And if you want to take a general view. That my website in a responsive device. In any kind of device. Like in iPad. How it will look. Now if you don't have a device here. Then choose responsive. And find the approximate width of your device. In total, your website should look good in all the width devices. How this happens. I will tell you this in this course. Now if you click here again. Then it will close. This responsive view will close. And as soon as it closes. Your website looks like this. I will close it. I will come back here. Now I will tell you about Meta Text. Here I will write like Meta. So look here Meta DESC is coming. Okay. I will click on Meta DESC. And here I can give the description of my page. Suppose I give. This is the page. This is a page about. This is a page which contains description. About Harry. Okay. And here whatever page content you have. You write whatever you want. Like I show you. Suppose you write what is SEO. Okay. What is SEO. You have written. And look here. This page has put this Meta Description. SEO stands for this in simple terms. Now it is not necessary that a search engine. Will parse your Meta DESC. It will not do this. If he liked it. Then he will parse it. And keep your Meta DESC here. If you have not put Meta DESC. Then Meta DESC can be generated from your content. So this is the responsibility of the search engine. What will Bing do? What will Google do? We do not know this. But from our side. Our page should be absolutely to the point. Especially if we are writing a blog. And we want our page to rank organically. So here you can see. That I have put Meta DESC. Now a Meta Keyword used to work a lot earlier. But now the Meta Keyword. That has been deprecated. Meta Keyword is not used at all now. The code of Meta Keywords looks something like this. But it is believed that. Meta Keywords. They do not rank at all in SEO. Because people abuse it more. Suppose you have written a page. About pets. And you have written. What is SEO in Meta Keyword. So it is not that your page will be ranked. I am here. I will correct the double quotes here. So if I put Meta Keyword here. It is not necessary that the search engine. Will consider it. Some search engines do this. That do not believe in Meta Keywords. They say. We do not want to see your Meta Keywords. You do not put it. So Meta Keywords used to work a lot earlier. But now it does not work. Now the content of your page is being parsed. And now the time of AI is coming. So especially more. Your content will be understood. What value is your content giving? It will be understood. It will be ranked accordingly. Now if you want to know exactly. About these Core Web Vitals. For example. If I right click and inspect. And go to Lighthouse. And for the desktop. I will take out the Lighthouse report. So some Core Web Vitals come. Like LCP comes. Then after that. FCP comes. First Contextual Paint. Now you can see here. Everything is 100. 100. 100. Look here. Now there was not much in this content. But here you can see. What is he saying. What are you doing. Pages with WebSocket. Cannot enter. Back Forward Cache. This has WebSocket. Because we are using this extension. Live Preview. Otherwise this is absolutely right. Accessibility is also 100. Everything is 100. This is a very good page. PWA is Progressive Web Apps. Which we will not make now. But you see here. First Contextual Paint. Largest Contextual Paint. Total Blocking Time. Cumulative Layout Shift. Speed Index. If you want to know about all this. Like what is First Contextual Paint. That what the user is going to see. How long has it been painted on the browser. So if you want to see this thing. Then you have to go to web.dev. Web.dev is a very good website. Which talks about all these things. And you can see here. That. He keeps talking about it. You can learn here. About all these things. What is it? If you want to learn PWA. Then you can learn PWA. About all these things. Here. There is a lot of good content. But we will focus on making HTML, CSS, JavaScript and websites in this course. This thing should have come to you according to me. Because of which I told you about it. If you have not accessed the Sigma Web Development series yet. Then do access it. Access the playlist. Bookmark it. Or click on the star. Or click and save it. That's all for this video guys. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you. Next time. Music."}
